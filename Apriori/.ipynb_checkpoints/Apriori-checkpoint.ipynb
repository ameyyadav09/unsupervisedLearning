    "###### Apriori Principle\n",
    "Let’s assume that we are running a grocery store with a very limited selection. We are interested in finding out which items were purchased together. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have only four items: item0, item1, item2, and item3. What are all the possible combinations in which can be purchased? We can have one item, say item0, alone, or two items, or three items, or all of the items together. \n",
    "\n",
    "If someone purchased two of item0 and four of item2, we don’t care. We’re concerned only that they purchased one or more of an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "General approach to the Apriori algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Collect: Any method.\n",
    "    2.Prepare: Any data type will work as we’re storing sets.\n",
    "    3.Analyze: Any method.\n",
    "    4.Train: Use the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets.\n",
    "    5.Test: Doesn’t apply.\n",
    "    6.Use: This will be used to find frequent itemsets and association rules between items.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"images/apriori.png\" title=\"All possible sets from available 4 images\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Above diagram shows all possible combinations of the items. big Ø means null set or a set containing no items. Lines connecting item sets indicate that two or more sets can be combined to form a larger set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that our goal is to find sets of items that are purchased together frequently. We measured frequency by the support of a set. The support of a set counted the percentage of transactions that contained that set. If we need to caluculate support for a set say {0,3}? we go through every transaction and ask, ”Did this transaction contain 0 and 3?” If the transaction did contain both those items, we increment the total. After scanning all of our data, we divide the total by the number of transactions, and we have our support. This result is for only one set: {0,3}. Like this we have to repeat this to get the support for every possible set. We can count the sets in above figure and see that for four items, we have to go over the data 15 times. This number gets large quickly. A data set that contains N possible items can generate 2N-1 possible itemsets. Stores selling 10,000 or more items aren’t uncommon. Even a store selling 100 items can generate $$1.26*10^{30} $$ possible itemsets. This would take a very long time to compute on a modern computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the time needed to compute this value, Apriori principle was devised. The Apriori principle helps us reduce the number of possible interesting itemsets. The Apriori principle says that if an itemset is frequent,\n",
    "then all of its subsets are frequent. In above image this means that if {0,1} is frequent, then {0} and {1} have to be frequent. This rule as it is doesn’t help us, but if we turn it inside out? that if an itemset is infrequent, then its supersets are also infrequent.\n",

    "In above image, the shaded itemset {2,3} is considered to be infrequent. From this information, we know that itemsets {0,2,3}, {1,2,3}, and {0,1,2,3} are also infrequent. This tells us that once we’ve computed the support of {2,3}, we don’t have to compute the support of {0,2,3}, {1,2,3}, and {0,1,2,3} because we know they won’t meet our requirements. Using this principle, we can halt the exponential growth of itemsets and compute a list of frequent item sets in a comparatively less time.\n",
